## Encouraging Student Partipicipation in Extra Curricular Achievements using an Incentivization Platform 

- A full stack web application leveraging a private blockchain that allows the students to showcase their achievements and receive suitable rewards for them in the form of VJCoins(Cryptocurreny of a Private University Blockchain), that can be consumed in on-campus activities thus creating a circular economy within campus. 
- The portal can be accessed by a web browser by students and faculty alike. Students submit applications of their achievements, highlighting the type of achievement and submitting a document of proof for it. They select a faculty, by whom they wish to review this application. The system then performs certain checks for duplication. After successful verification, the faculty then suitably rewards the student. 
- Along with the web application, there is additional functionality for Wallet Browser Extension for key-pair generation, management, and sending transactions. The developed prototype is operational and will thus lead a better student and faculty engagement through incentivization.
